    <img src="../img/cannoli_dip.jpg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Ricotta.</strong> Like a true cannoli, this dip has a creamy ricotta base.
        <strong>Cream cheese.</strong> Helps firm up the texture so that this dip is dippable.
        <strong>Powdered sugar and vanilla.</strong> For adding sweetness and flavor to the ricotta and cream cheese.
        <strong>Mini chocolate chips.</strong> For a crunchy texture and a touch of chocolate.
        <strong>Waffle cones.</strong> To mimic the shell of a cannoli, these are broken up and used for dipping.

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup ricotta</li>
        <li>8 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup powdered sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2/3 cup mini chocolate chips</li>
        <li>waffle cones, broken into dippable pieces</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Using a stand mixer (or a hand mixer + large bowl), beat ricotta, cream cheese, and powdered sugar on medium-high speed until smooth, about 3-5 minutes. Add in vanilla extract and whip for another 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Taste test the dip. If youâ€™d like it sweeter, add more powdered sugar, about 2 tablespoons at a time. You can safely add up to another 1/2 cup of powdered sugar (8 tablespoons) without negatively impacting consistency.</li>
        <li>Fold in mini chocolate chips, reserving some to sprinkle on top for decoration, if desired.</li>
        <li>Serve dip immediately with broken waffle cones for dipping.</li>
    </ol>
