    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        An espresso martini is a coffee cocktail made with espresso, coffee liqueur, Irish cream, and a dash of simple syrup. 
        Itâ€™s sweet and rich, with a bold coffee flavor coming from the coffee liqueur and brewed espresso.
        Espresso martinis are popular because they only take a few minutes to make! 
        Simply add all of the ingredients to a cocktail shaker along with cold ice cubes. 
        Shake it up until all of the ingredients are combined, and pour into a chilled martini glass.
