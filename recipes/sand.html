    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>OREO.</strong> Begin by smashing up Oreos. I put mine in my food processor and blended until they were crumbs. Set aside.
        <strong>PUDDING.</strong> Mix cream cheese, butter, and powdered sugar with mixer in a medium bowl. Fold in cool whip until well blended. In a separate bowl mix pudding mix and milk with a whisk. Once combined well, add pudding to cream cheese mixture.
        <strong>LAYER + GARNISH.</strong> Place a few tablespoons of Oreo crumbs in your cup or small jar. Add some of the creamy mixture (I do this by adding the creamy mixture to a gallon bag and cutting off the corner so it goes in the jar more easily.) Bang down on a wash cloth on the table to get all bubbles out. Add a few more tablespoons of Oreo Crumbs. Top off with some more cream mixture and sprinkle on a few more crumbs. Top off with more crumbs and a drink umbrella.
